# 42 NetPractice Project

This repository contains my solutions for the NetPractice project at 42.

## About The Project

NetPractice is a series of 10 exercises designed to teach the fundamentals of TCP/IP networking. Each level presents a non-functional network that must be fixed by correctly configuring IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing tables.

## Key Concepts Learned

- IP Addressing: Assigning unique addresses to hosts and routers.
- Subnetting: Dividing networks into smaller, efficient subnets using subnet masks.
- Routing: Configuring static and default routes to allow communication between different networks.
